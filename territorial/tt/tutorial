1. Frequently Asked Questions


QUESTION   How can I join a clan?

In the username box, type in your username like so: "[CLAN] user"Replace "CLAN" and "user" with names of your choice. The ranking of your clan can be seen on the clan leaderboard. The name of a clan must have less than 8 letters. Players with the same clan tag are always assigned to the same team.


QUESTION   How do I create a clan?

The mechanism is the same as in the prior answer. You append the clan tag to your name. A clan must win at least one alliance game in order to be listed on the clan leaderboard. Every day, clans with less than 0.001 points will be removed from the list.


QUESTION   How can I play with my friends?

You can click on "More" in the main menu and select lobby 2. In this lobby, fewer players are active. This is a good place to play with friends.


QUESTION   When do special games take place?

Battle royale contests take place every 30 minutes at xx:00 and xx:30 (for example, at 12:30, 13:00, 13:30, and so on). Alliance contests take place every 30 minutes at xx:15 and xx:45. Rated one-vs-one games take place every 5 minutes at xx:00, xx:05, and so on. Zombie games take place every 5 minutes at xx:03, xx:08, and so on.


QUESTION   How do I create a one-vs-one account?

The one-vs-one account is created automatically for you. If you play the game in the browser, make sure to allow cookies. You can check the password of your account in the main menu. Type "password" into the username input field. When a number other than 0 appears, your account is valid.It's recommended that you store your password safely. This way, you will keep your account when you delete the app or clear cookies. If the password gets lost, you have to build up your ELO from zero again. Your account will lose one ELO point per day. Once it reaches 0, your account will be deleted.


QUESTION   How can I transfer my one-vs-one account from mobile to desktop?

Get your password, as described in the prior question, and paste it on your desktop machine. There, open Territorial.io, type "password" into the username box, replace the password, and press enter. The same logic applies in reverse.


QUESTION   How can I change the color of my territory?

In the main menu, you can click the little icon with the color grid in the bottom left corner. Here you can set the RGB values of your territory.


QUESTION   How can I create my own maps?

You can upload your own map and play it as a single player. Go to the main menu and click on "Singleplayer". Then drag and drop your image file into the window. This feature is only available for desktop users.
To create full custom single-player scenarios see under Section 5.


QUESTION   Is it possible to report users with offensive usernames?

We recommend enabling the "Hide Usernames" button in the main menu to hide usernames.
QUESTION   How can I report a bug?
You may report a bug at the email address in Section 7.


QUESTION   How can I support Territorial.io?

You can support Territorial.io by playing it and by creating and sharing content about it.




2. The balance


Your balance is visible in the mostly green rectangle at the top of the screen. You will see that this value steadily increases. Its maximum value depends on your territorial size. The balance can also be seen on the map below (above in one-vs-one games) the username. Therefore, you can always see how high the balances of other players are.

You earn interest on your balance. Therefore, the higher your balance, the higher your interest income. Furthermore, you can use a part of your balance to attack enemy territory. How much of your balance you want to invest depends on the percentage bar at the bottom of the screen.

The balance also represents the strength of your defense. The higher your balance, the stronger your defense.

The balance therefore abstracts the concepts of economy, population, and army.




3. Borders


When you conquer new territories, you should always take care about which countries will border you. Sometimes it's better to not conquer a weak "intermediary" between you and a strong enemy. There are also some other interesting strategies related to borders. You can think of the border as the only place where your forces defend your country. Therefore, it's a good strategy to keep your border as compact as possible. Your border may also adjoin mountains, the ocean, or the edge of the map. This type of border doesn't bind your defensive forces. This also explains why it's so hard to attack island nations.

To conquer a nation completely, your attack forces must be at least twice as strong as the defense forces of the enemy.




4. Maximum income


I (the creator of Territorial.io) want to discuss this concept here shortly. You may already have seen that your interest income can be much higher than your territorial income. Your maximum balance is equal to 150 times your pixel count. Your maximum interest income is equal to 100 times your pixel count. The balance turns red once peak income is reached. At this point, you can only increase your income by gaining more territory.

I will discuss a short example: Let's assume you control 1000 pixels. Your maximum income is set at a balance of 100 x 1000 = 100 000. If your balance is lower or higher than 100 000, your interest income is lower. Your maximum balance in this case is 150 x 1000, or 150 000.

Note that the interest rate decreases at the beginning of the game. Furthermore, the interest rate is proportional to the size of your territory.

In one-vs-one endgames in the case of equally distributed territories, the best strategy (in my opinion) is to repeatedly attack at maximum income (i.e., when your balance turns red).




5. Custom single-player scenarios


You can load JSON files into the game. These files can include player information like spawn coordinates, colors, and team IDs. And best of all, you can create your own maps. Be informed: Water is definied as a color where the blue value is bigger than the red and green value. Mountain is definied as a color where red, green and blue have all the same value (gray).
An example JSON file can be downloaded here:
